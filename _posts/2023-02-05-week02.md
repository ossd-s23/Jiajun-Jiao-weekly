title: Week 2 - Code of Conduct Activity & Browser Add-on Activity
---

<!-- make your blog post, address in it the questions in the Code of Conduct activity and reflect on your experience working on an add-on project. -->

This week we mainly focused on the topics about how to contribute to open source projects and FOSS concepts, started the Code of Conduct Activity, as well as the Browser Add-on Activity.

<!--more-->

Code of Conduct document is a set of guidelines that outlines the expected behavior and values of individuals within an organization or community. After visiting the [code of conduct document](https://golang.org/conduct) for the [Go project](https://golang.org/), I think that the benefit for the projects to have such document is that it establishes the standard for the behavior and the sense of values in the collaborative environment. Therefore, the ambiguous policies would be eliminated to the greatest extent.

Comparing the above document with the [Contributor Covenant website](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct) which it's based on, I found that the former modified some of the wording, and most importantly, changed the "Enforcement" template to the "Conflict Resolution" section, which provides the Go project's project-specific way to resolve the violation of the code of conduct.

The Contributor Covenant website has a list of projects that adapted their code of conduct. One of such [code of conduct document](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php) is from [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/). This one from Eclipse differs from the one from Go project in the aspect of extra detailed elaboration of Investigation of Potential Code Violations, Actions, and No Retaliation. In the wording, the Eclipse one covers more personnel categories and scopes, which I believe is a result of its bulkiness and control complexity.

Another project -[Sugar Labs](https://sugarlabs.org/) - also has a [code of conduct](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Legal/Code_of_Conduct) document.This one is based on another code of conduct - [Ubuntu Code of Conduct v2.0](http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct), and is quite different from the Go project's one. It merges its values into the code of conduct, discarding sections on Pledge, Standards, Responsibilities, Scope, and Conflict Resolution, but elaborate detailedly on how to do when the member disagree and is unsure. It even provides guidelines to step down considerately. Overall, it's more casual and flexible comparing to the one from Go project.

Finally, I picked the open source project [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) which I have previously used. I searched through its files and [found out](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/third_party/zstandard/zstd/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that its community expect project participants to adhere to the [Code of Conduct adopted by Facebook](https://opensource.fb.com/code-of-conduct/). After comparison, I noticed that this Code of Conduct from Facebook is directly adapted from [Contributor Covenant, version 1.4](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html) without and change. Therefore it's quite similar with the one from Go project.
