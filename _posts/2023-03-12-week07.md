<!-- Make your blog post: reflect on your group work, your project selection, talk about your hopes and worries regarding the group work -->

During Week 7, our project group was formed, consisting of Connor, Shenghan, and myself. We engaged in a thoughtful discussion to determine which project we were all interested in working on. We discovered that FreeCodeCamp was a mutual point of interest for all three of us, and we had each completed a project evaluation on it. As a result, we chose FreeCodeCamp as the project to which we intend to contribute.

Our decision to select FreeCodeCamp was based on several factors. First and foremost, it is an incredibly active project with an enthusiastic and supportive community. Our evaluations indicated that this project would be a great fit for us. Moreover, working on FreeCodeCamp presents an excellent opportunity for me to develop and hone my programming skills, which is something I'm particularly excited about. I am hopeful that our contributions will have a meaningful impact on programmers around the world, including ourselves.

However, I do have some concerns regarding our ability to keep pace with such an active community. I worry that we might struggle to follow up on issues in a timely manner, potentially missing out on opportunities to contribute effectively.

In other news, the following week — Week 8 — is Spring Break. I am planning to embark on a cruise with friends, traveling to Orlando and the Bahamas aboard the Norwegian Getaway, part of the Norwegian Cruise Line fleet. Upon my return, I intend to contribute comprehensive information about the ship's restaurants, services, and facilities to its Wikipedia page, drawing from my firsthand experience.
