<!-- Make your blog post for the week. Comment on the git exercises we did in class. Comment on the work with your team and progress you have made towards your first browser extension (what are some problems the group is facing, what good things happened, how do you fit into the collaboration, what are your biggest contributions) -->

This week is quite busy. In Tuesday's class we discussed the anatomy of a FOSS project, and started exploring the Git actvity in the first class. In the second class on Thursday, we explored Version control systems and Git, mainly about VCS Terminologies. Finally, we learnt how to do Project evaluation, and went through three examples. Additionally, this week our group continued to work on the Browser Add-on Activity from last week, made great progress and finished it.

![Git Workflow](../images/Git%20flow.jpg)

Among all of these topics, I feel that Git exercises were quite USEFUL. Previously I only used the automatically commit and push from VS Code and seldom did any manually git commands. However, In class I learnt the overall workflow of the version control system, and most importantly, the whole process of "fork -> clone -> add remote -> sychronize upstream -> resolve conflict -> add to staging area -> commit -> push". It's quite useful that in my another CS Virtual Reality class, I directly used this whole sychronizing method to keep my local updated.

As for the group project, we had a really tortuous process. Firstly we met after class and got the idea of "Hype Tabs" which makes the tabs more colorful. However, after creating basic files such as README.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, we were stuck for two hours. Although the example add-on code seems to be simple and the Mozilla documentation is clear, we cannot even step further. After a long time of discussion, we finally can change the background color. Afterwards, I figured out by myself that *excuteScript* only works after *onClick*, and *update* only works after *onActivated*. So I created two listeners and they both work. I messaged the group members and thought that might be our break point. Then on Thursday, Jack also updated his branch since he figured out that we can change the theme every time when the tabs are switch without even having to use tabs.query. Also was able to change the title and icon of all tabs after onClick. After that, Leah provided the way to make the color being randomly generated. Finally, we had a Zoom meeting on Sunday morning. As I recorded on EdStem, we collaborated together and splited the tasks. All the files were updated and the main functionality was also merged to the main branch. I created a Discord channel at the very end, and provided it to the community along with my contact email address. Additionally, we also decided how to present our project in class on Monday.

That was really a rich life last week. I feel like I've learnt a lot and devoted myself into the collaboration, which I rarely did before. I really appreciate the knowledge and chances that this course provides me.
