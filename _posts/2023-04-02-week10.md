To be honest, this week was pretty laid-back, but I still wanted to share a few highlights with you all. On Monday, we had an introspective session where we wrote our midterm reflections. It was a great opportunity to look back at the first half of the semester and take stock of everything I've learned so far. I must say, it feels like I've come a long way already!

Wednesday brought our usual group meeting, and it turned out to be quite productive. We managed to crack the code on that pesky issue that had been bothering us last week. With that problem solved, we were able to dive back into our group projects and make some solid progress.

And that's about it for this week! Nothing too earth-shattering, but sometimes it's nice to have a slower week to catch our breath and recharge.
